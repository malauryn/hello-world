  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Lauryn!</p>
  <h2>Selections from CWD Index</h2>
  The first selection I made was
  <a href="https://fffff.at/kardashian-krypt">Kardashian Krypt</a> I love how random it is haha!
</body> <br>
<p>I found actual treasure. My second pick was <a href="https://thefreemovie.buzz/">The FREE Movie</a> which is
  literally a hand drawn version of the BEE movie.
<p>
<p>My third and final pick was, <a href="https://iknowwhereyourcatlives.com/">I know where your cat lives</a>,which
  strangely also shows pictures of people and dogs?</p>
